My name is Sam Prakash, and I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to introduce myself.

I hail from Tirunelveli and recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from Thiagrajar College of Engineering, Madurai, in the year 2022. Despite my non-IT background, my passion for mathematics has been a driving force in my academic journey. During my school years, I achieved remarkable scores, securing a perfect 100 in 10th standard and 200 in 12th standard.

My enthusiasm for mathematics naturally evolved into a keen interest in problem-solving, which ultimately led me to explore the field of Information Technology. To bridge the gap in my skills, I underwent Java training at Payilagam Institutions. Subsequently, I prepared rigorously for the Zoho interview, and in October 2023, I successfully cleared the Zoho School for Graduate Studies exam.

Participating in the boot camp at Zoho was a transformative experience that not only honed my technical skills but also contributed significantly to my personal development. The program provided an immersive environment where I could enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain valuable insights into the IT industry.

I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. Thank you for considering my introduction, and I look forward to the possibility of further discussing how my background and experiences align with your organization's goals.
